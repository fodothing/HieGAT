1. This is the code of paper "Improving Text Classification Performance of Graph Neural Network with Hierarchical Pooling."

2. Open this in colab platform and click the "connect" and run to reproduce the result (replace the dataset file path).

3. The original training set and test set have been determined, so k-fold cross-validation is not appicable. This experiment uses 1 time of shuffle, and runs 5 times after each shuffle to take the average.
